I flew to Tokyo just for the day to meet up with [Joi Ito] while he was in town
for an MIT Media Lab event. Joi is an accomplished writer, photographer, diver,
and a long-time friend. He had just gotten the Leica Q, and we talked about why
I hadn't gone digital yet. (Ilford HP5 Plus 400, Nokton 35mm f/1.2 II, Leica M6)
