Bassel sent this tweet just weeks before his own arrest. It would read like
dramatic irony if not for the real tragedy that Syria has suffered.

Of course, Bassel's arrest did not last months, but rather years. He was
detained on March 15, 2012. Then one year ago he was taken from Adra Prison
in Damascus and disappeared for good.

Bassel did not want to be a hero. But for us he became one.
