The Beijing-based artist Matt Hope was commissioned to build a custom
soundsystem for *CCD, The Community*, a satellite event to this year's Beijing
Design Week, so he stole a page from his teenage speaker plan book and realized
the project in common plasterboard and off-the-shelf speaker drivers.

The Weak Soundsystem fit right in at the CCD Pavilion, nestled in the courtyard
of White Space Beijing, and survived a week of exposure to the cultural and
climatic elements of Caochangdi.

I was there to capture the destruction on film.
